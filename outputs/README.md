# **MFBF Therapy Sheets - Output Folder**

## **Overview**
This folder contains the **generated Monocular Fixation in a Binocular Field (MFBF) therapy sheets**, designed for **amblyopic patients** to improve **visual acuity and binocular vision**. The sheets are categorized based on **difficulty levels** and are optimized for use with **anaglyph glasses** (red-green filters).

## **Usage Instructions**
1. **Download** the therapy sheets from the respective difficulty level.
2. **Print** them on **high-quality paper**.
3. **Use anaglyph glasses** (red-green) to complete the visual exercises.
4. **Follow the progression** from **Easy â†’ Medium â†’ Hard**.
5. **Track improvements** in **visual acuity and binocular coordination**.

## **File Details**
- **Easy Level**: Basic exercises like word and letter searches, and mazes.
- **Medium Level**: More challenging puzzles such as crosswords and spatial recognition tasks.
- **Hard Level**: Advanced cognitive challenges like **Sudoku and cryptic crosswords**.
- **all_green_game.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook used to generate the therapy sheets.

## **Results & Benefits**
- **Enhances visual acuity, tracking, and motor function**.
- **Encourages binocular vision rather than patching therapy**.
- **Adaptable for different patient needs with increasing difficulty levels**.

## **License**
This project is open-source and available for **academic and research purposes**.
