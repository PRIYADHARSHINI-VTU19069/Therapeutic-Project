# Monocular Fixation in a Binocular Field (MFBF) Therapy Sheets

## Project Overview

The project aims to construct effective **Monocular Fixation in a Binocular Field (MFBF)** therapy sheets to enhance visual acuity, visual motor function, and visual tracking. This therapy is designed as part of a randomized controlled trial for improving the visual performance of adult amblyopic patients. It incorporates a series of exercises and targets that challenge visual perception and promote focusing on specific points.

## Design

The therapy sheets are structured to guide patients through various levels of difficulty. The goal is to improve visual coordination and efficiency of accommodation. The therapy includes **three difficulty levels**: early, medium, and hard, with varying **font sizes**. The therapy incorporates **anaglyph glasses** that allow patients to use both eyes, with only one eye seeing the central target and the other seeing the background.

### Key Features:
- **Target Design**: The targets are presented in **red** and **green** colors, where each eye is directed to focus on specific points.
- **Progression**: The difficulty increases gradually, requiring more sustained fixation and the use of both eyes together.
- **Effectiveness**: Enhances visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, and visual coordination.

## Methods

The MFBF therapy sheets are designed with specific exercises for adult amblyopic patients. The target layout is designed to stimulate the accommodation of the eye by using anaglyph glasses, which isolate the central target for one eye and the background for the other.

- **3 Levels of Difficulty**: Easy, Medium, and Hard, with font sizes decreasing as the patient progresses.
- **Use of Anaglyph Glasses**: Patients wear glasses where one lens filters out the red or green target, allowing monocular fixation with binocular field views.
- **Assessment**: Evaluates the patient's ability to focus and track objects while using both eyes, improving overall visual function.

## Results

The MFBF therapy sheets are expected to produce:
- **Increased visual acuity** and enhanced **visual motor function**.
- Improved **visual tracking** and a greater ability to focus on targets within a binocular field.
- Positive effects on **amblyopia treatment** through gradual progression from larger to smaller font sizes.
- Higher treatment adherence rates compared to traditional occlusion therapies.

## Conclusion

This study demonstrates that **Monocular Fixation in a Binocular Field (MFBF)** therapy sheets are **more effective** than standard occlusion therapy in treating amblyopia in children and adults. Not only does MFBF therapy improve **visual acuity**, but it also significantly enhances **binocular vision** compared to traditional patching methods. Additionally, the higher **treatment adherence** rates suggest that MFBF therapy may be more acceptable and easier for patients to maintain. This approach represents a promising alternative to **standard occlusion therapy**, providing a more **effective and patient-friendly treatment option**.

## Future Work

Future research will continue to refine the design and assess the long-term effects of MFBF therapy on amblyopia treatment. Additional trials will explore the therapyâ€™s impact on different age groups and compare its effectiveness with other vision rehabilitation techniques.
